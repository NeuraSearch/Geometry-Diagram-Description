b^2, then the area of the pavilion is A = a^2 + b^2.\n\nThe pavilion is a square, and the pavilion step BC is also a square, then the height of the pavilion step BC is BC = a.\n\nSince the pavilion step BC is a square, its area is B = b^2, then the area of the pavilion step BC is B = a^2 + b^2.\n\nThe pavilion step BC is a square, and the pavilion step DE is also a square, then the height of the pavilion step DE is DE = a.\n\nSince the pavilion step DE is a square, its area is D = d^2, then the area of the pavilion step DE is D = a^2 + d^2.\n\nThe pavilion step DE is a square, and the pavilion step EG is also a square, then the height of the pavilion step EG is EG = a.\n\nSince the pavilion step EG is a square, its area is E = e^2, then the area of the pavilion step EG is E = a^2 +

then the area of the pavilion step GE is G = a^2 + g^2.\n\nThe pavilion step GE is a square, and the pavilion step GF is also a square, then the height of the pavilion step GF is GF = a.\n\nSince the pavilion step GF is a square, its area is F = f^2, then the area of the pavilion step GF is F = a^2 + f^2.\n\nThe pavilion step GF is a square, and the pavilion step GH is also a square, then the height of the pavilion step GH is GH = a.\n\nSince the pavilion step GH is a square, its area is H = h^2, then the area of the pavilion step GH is H = a^2 + h^2.\n\nThe pavilion step GH is a square, and the pavilion step GI is also a square, then the height of the pavilion step GI is GI = a.\n\nSince the pavilion step GI is a square, its area is I = i^2, then the area of the pavilion step GI is I

C be the midpoint of AC, and D be the midpoint of AB. \n\nThen, CB = CD = 2N_0, and DB = CD = 2N_1. \n\nSince the midpoint of AC is C, then AC = CD, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC = 2N_0, which means that AC = 2N_0. \n\nTherefore, AC =
