The length of \u2220A = N_0, so the length of \u2220B = N_1 = 120.0\u00b0\n\n2. The length of \u2220B = N_1 = 120.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220C = N_2 = 140.0\u00b0\n\n3. The length of \u2220C = N_2 = 140.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220D = N_3 = 40.0\u00b0\n\n4. The length of \u2220D = N_3 = 40.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220E = N_4 = 60.0\u00b0\n\n5. The length of \u2220E = N_4 = 60.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220F = N_5 = 80.0\u00b0\n\n6. The length of \u2220F = N_5 = 80.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220G = N_6 = 120.0\u00b0\n\n7. The length of \u2220G = N_6 = 120.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220H = N_7 = 140.0\u00b0\n\n8. The length of \u2220H = N_7 = 140.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220I = N_8 = 40.0\u00b0\n\n9. The length of \u2220I = N_8 = 40.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220J = N_9 = 60.0\u00b0\n\n10. The length of \u2220J = N_9 = 60.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220K = N_10 = 80.0\u00b0\n\n11. The length of \u2220K = N_10 = 80.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220L = N_11 = 120.0\u00b0\n\n12. The length of \u2220L = N_11 = 120.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220M = N_12 = 140.0\u00b0\n\n13. The length of \u2220M = N_12 = 140.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220N = N_13 = 40.0\u00b0\n\n14. The length of \u2220N = N_13 = 40.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220O = N_14 = 60.0\u00b0\n\n15. The length of \u2220O = N_14 = 60.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220P = N_15 = 80.0\u00b0\n\n16. The length of \u2220P = N_15 = 80.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220Q = N_16 = 120.0\u00b0\n\n17. The length of \u2220Q = N_16 = 120.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220R = N_17 = 140.0\u00b0\n\n18. The length of \u2220R = N_17 = 140.0\u00b0, so the length of \u2220S = N_18 = 40.0\u00b0\n\n19",

  "51": " [40.0]  [60.0]  [70.0]\n\nComment: I think you have a problem with the angle notation.\n\nComment: The angle notation is correct.  It's the question that's incorrect.\n\nComment: @GregoryGrant  I don't think so.  The angles are all correct.  The problem is that the angles are all in the same triangle, so there is no way to determine which angle is which.\n\nComment: @RossMillikan I don't think you're correct.  The angles are all correct, but the angles are not in the same triangle.  The first angle is \u2220B, the second is \u2220C, the third is \u2220D, and the fourth is \u2220A.\n\nComment: @GregoryGrant  You are correct.  I misread the question.  I'm going to delete my comments.\n\nAnswer: If $A$ is the midpoint of $AB$, then $\\angle B = \\angle A$.  So $\\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle B = \\angle C$.  Since $\\angle B = \\angle C$, then $\\angle C = \\angle B$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle A$.  So $\\angle C = \\angle A = \\angle B$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A$.  So $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.  Thus $\\angle C = \\angle B = \\angle A = \\angle C$.

If you have a new question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/ask) button.\n\nAnswer: I think you're trying to solve this problem:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThe height of the flagpole AC is 9.0 meters.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThis is not a linear programming problem.  There are two variables, N_0 and N_1, and two equations, N_0 + N_1 = 1.5 and N_0 + N_1 + N_2 = 6.0.  There is no way to solve this problem by linear programming.\n\nThe solution is to use the method of substitution.  First, let's find N_0.  We know that N_0 + N_1 = 1.5.  So, N_0 = 1.5 - N_1.  Then, we know that N_0 + N_1 + N_2 = 6.0.  So, N_2 = 6.0 - N_0 - N_1.  Then, we know that N_0 + N_1 + N_2 = 6.0.  So, N_1 = 6.0 - N_0 - N_2.  Then, we know that N_0 + N_1 + N_2 = 6.0.  So, N_2 = 6.0 - N_0 - N_1.  Then, we know that N_0 + N_1 + N_2 = 6.0.  So, N_1 = 6.0 - N_0 - N_2.  Then, we know that N_0 + N_1 + N_2 = 6.0.  So, N_2 = 6.0 - N_0 - N_1.  Then, we know that N_0 + N_1 + N_2 = 6.0.  So, N_1 = 6.0 - N_0",

Then the triangle $AEB$ is isosceles with $AB = x$. The angle $CED$ is equal to $\\pi/2$. Therefore, $CD = x/2$. The angle $BDE$ is equal to $\\pi/2$.

In order to get the best possible answers, it is helpful if you say in what context you encountered the problem, and what your thoughts on it are; this will prevent people from telling you things you already know, and help them give their answers at the right level. Also, many find the use of imperative (\"Solve this for me please!\") to be rude no matter who you are, and that includes asking the person reading your post to provide their work for free.\n\nAnswer: The given triangle is right-angled at $C$ with $N_0$ as the angle bisector of $C$.\n\nLet $x$ be the length of $AC$.\n\nWe have $\\cos A = \\frac{x}{N_0}$\n\n$x = N_0\\cos A$\n\n$x = N_0\\cdot \\frac{N_1}{N_0}$\n\n$x = N_1\\cos A$\n\n$x = N_1\\cdot \\frac{N_2}{N_1}$\n\n$x = N_2\\cos A$\n\n$x = N_2\\cdot \\frac{N_0}{N_2}$\n\n$x = N_0\\cos A$\n\n$\\therefore \\cos A = \\frac{N_0}{N_1\\cdot N_2\\cdot N_0}$\n\nAnswer: Let $N_0, N_1, N_2$ be the three sides of the triangle.\n\nLet $a$ be the length of $AC$, $b$ be the length of $BC$, $c$ be the length of $CA$.\n\nWe have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (N_0 + N_1 + N_2)^2$.\n\nSo, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (N_0 + N_1 + N_2)^2 - 2(N_0 + N_1 + N_2) = N_0^2 + N_1^2 + N_2^2 - 2(N_0 + N_1 + N_2)$.\n\nSo, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = N_0^2 + N_1^2 + N_2^2 - 2(N_0 + N_1 + N_2) - 2(N_0^2 + N_1^2 + N_2^2) = N_0^2 + N_1^2 + N_2^2 - 2(N_0 + N_1 + N_2) - 2(N_0^2 + N_1^2 + N_2^2) = N_0^2 + N_1^2 + N_2^2 - 2(N_0 + N_1 + N_2) - 2(N_0^2 + N_1^2 + N_2^2) = N_0^2 + N_1^2 + N_2^2 - 2(N_0 + N_1 + N_2) - 2(N_0^2 + N_1^2 + N_2^2) = N_0^2 + N_1^2 + N_2^2 - 2(N_0 + N_1 + N_2) - 2(N_0^2 + N_1^2 + N_2^2) = N_0^2 + N_1^2 + N_2^2 - 2(N_0 + N_1 + N_2) - 2(N_0^2 + N_1^2 + N_2^2",

See https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference\n\nComment: You can also use the [MathJax tutorial](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) to format your questions.\n\nAnswer: I don't think you can solve this problem without using trigonometry.\n\nThe answer is $130^\\circ$.\n\nLet $a$ be the radius of the circumscribed circle.\n\nLet $b$ be the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\nThen $a^2 = b^2 + 2ab\\cos(\\angle AOB)$.\n\nSince $\\angle AOB = 130^\\circ$, we have $2ab\\cos(\\angle AOB) = 2ab\\cos(130^\\circ) = 2ab\\cos(180^\\circ - 130^\\circ) = 2ab\\cos(50^\\circ) = 2ab\\sin(50^\\circ)$.\n\nSo $a^2 = b^2 + 2ab\\sin(50^\\circ) = b^2 + 2ab\\sin(130^\\circ - 50^\\circ) = b^2 + 2ab\\sin(80^\\circ) = b^2 + 2ab\\sin(130^\\circ) = b^2 + 2ab\\sin(130^\\circ - 130^\\circ) = b^2 + 2ab\\sin(0^\\circ) = b^2 + 2ab = b^2 + 2b = b^2 + 2 = b^2$.\n\nTherefore $a = b$.\n\nTherefore $b = 130^\\circ$.\n\nComment: I don't understand how to use the theorem of the circumscribed circle of a triangle.\n\nComment: I think the question is wrong. The answer should be $130^\\circ$.\n\nComment: I've updated my answer.\n\nComment: Thanks, I have learned a lot from your answer.\n\nComment: You're welcome.\n\nAnswer: I'm not sure if this is what you are looking for, but here is a hint:\n\nIf $O$ is the center of the inscribed circle, then $O$ is also the center of the circumscribed circle.  Therefore, $O$ is the center of the inscribed circle.  In particular, $O$ is on the inscribed circle.  Now, if $O$ is on the inscribed circle, then $O$ is on the circumscribed circle.

As it's currently written, it's hard to tell exactly what you're asking.\n\nAnswer: I think you have the right idea, but the problem is that the angles are in degrees, and you are giving the angles in radians.\n\nYou can use the fact that the sine of an angle in radians is the same as the cosine of the same angle in degrees.\n\n$$\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{180}$$\n\nYou can use this to convert your degrees to radians.\n\nThen you can use the formula for the sine of an angle to find the answer.\n\n$$\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSo the answer is $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\nComment: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand. Could you please explain it in more detail?\n\nComment: @JasonWang The angle in radians is 1/6 of a full circle, so you can convert it to degrees. Then you can use the formula for the sine of an angle to find the answer.\n\nComment: Thank you very much for your help. I have a question.

You can find the area of a circle using the formula A = pi r^2.  Then you can find the area of the triangle inscribed in the circle.  The sum of the areas of the triangle and the circle is the area of the whole figure.\n\nComment: @JoeWisdom Thank you for your answer. I will try to solve it.\n\nAnswer: <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/H243m.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by the radius of the circle, but it's not the radius of the circle inscribed in the triangle.  If you mean the radius of the circle inscribed in the triangle, then the radius is $r=\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{1+2\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$.  The area of the circle is $A=r^2\\pi$.  The area of the triangle is $A_T=\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$, where $s=\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}$.  So the area of the whole figure is $A=A_T+A_C$.  You should be able to take it from here.\n\nComment: Thank you for your answer. I have tried to solve it.\n\nComment: @RaymondZhang I'm glad I could help.

  "3949": "\n\nI have tried to solve it using the formula of the tangent and the tangent points, but I can't solve it.\n\nAnswer: The tangent of the circle at the point $P$ is the line through $P$ that is perpendicular to the radius.  So, $BP$ is perpendicular to $AP$, so $BP = \\frac{AP}{\\sqrt{1 + (AP)^2}}$.  Then $BD = BP + CP = \\frac{AP}{\\sqrt{1 + (AP)^2}} + \\frac{AC}{\\sqrt{1 + (AC)^2}} = \\frac{AP}{\\sqrt{1 + (AP)^2}} + \\frac{AC}{\\sqrt{1 + (AC)^2}} = \\frac{AP}{\\sqrt{1 + (AP)^2}} + \\frac{AP}{\\sqrt{1 + (AP)^2}} = 2AP$.\n\nComment: I have a question. I think I understand your answer, but I don't understand the last part. I'm not sure what the last part means. I think it means that the answer is 2AP, but I don't understand what the last part means.\n\nComment: @user11711395 It's just a simplification.  If you have $2AP$, then $AP = \\frac{2AP}{2} = \\frac{AP}{2}$.  The same is true for $AC$.\n\nComment: I see. Thank you for your help.",

  "6835": "\n\nAnswer: The problem can be solved by setting up a system of equations, which can be done by first converting the units from nautical miles to kilometers, then using the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the distance between A and B.\n\nTo convert the units, we can use the conversion factor of 1 nautical mile = 1.852 km.\n\nTo use the Pythagorean theorem, we can set up the following system of equations:\n\n$d_{AB} = d_{AM} + d_{MB}$\n\n$d_{AM} = N_0 + N_1 \\cdot t_1$\n\n$d_{MB} = N_2 + N_3 \\cdot t_2$\n\nWhere $d_{AB}$ is the distance between A and B, $d_{AM}$ is the distance between A and M, $d_{MB}$ is the distance between M and B, $N_0$ is the distance between A and M, $N_1$ is the speed of the ship in nautical miles per hour, $N_2$ is the distance between M and B, and $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the times it takes for the ship to travel from A to M and from M to B respectively.\n\nTo solve for $d_{AB}$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to get the following equation:\n\n$d_{AB}^2 = (N_0 + N_1 \\cdot t_1)^2 + (N_2 + N_3 \\cdot t_2)^2$\n\nAfter simplifying the equation, we can solve for $d_{AB}$ as follows:\n\n$d_{AB} = \\sqrt{(N_0 + N_1 \\cdot t_1)^2 + (N_2 + N_3 \\cdot t_2)^2}$\n\nThis solution gives the distance between A and B in kilometers.\n\nComment: Please explain the solution.\n\nComment: @RaajeshKumar I have added an explanation to the solution.",

The problem statement is ambiguous.  What is the relationship between the angle at A, B, and C?  What are the units of the angles?  What are the units of the lengths?  How do you define the degree of an angle?  What is the relationship between N_0 and N_1?  Are the angles measured in degrees or radians?

In order to get the best possible answers, it is helpful if you say in what context you encountered the problem, and what your thoughts on it are; this will prevent people from telling you things you already know, and help them give their answers at the right level. Also, many find the use of imperative (\"Solve this for me please!\") to be rude and unwelcome.\n\nAnswer: \\strong{Hint:}\n\nLet $M$ be the midpoint of $BD$. Then $M$ is the midpoint of $AE$ and $AE$ is the midpoint of $BD$. So $AE=2BD/3$.\n\nComment: I am not sure how to use the hint to solve the problem.
